Solidity-Inbox

Tutorial Source: https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide/

Solidity message example (Inbox.Sol) and companion inbox.test.js file with the Solidity deploy script.

Makes use of initial message and new message. Can be compiled on Remix.Ethereum.Org.

This was the first in my set of tutorials introducing me to the Solidity language.
